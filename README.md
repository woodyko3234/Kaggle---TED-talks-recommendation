# Kaggle-TED-talks-recommendation
From https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/ted-talks

It's an unsupervised machine learning project.

Since we can easily do some sorting/filtering to find out the talks we feel interested, such as speaker names, number of comments, duration, ratings, tags, and popularity (views), I'm kind of interested in analyzing the transcript data, building another related talks recommendation algorithm, and comparing it with the related_talks column in ted_main.csv.

NLTK and BoW (Bag-of-Words) are applied in this model.

I also do some words lemmatizing and stopwords removal before conducting word counting and analysis, to make the dataset simpler.

Check the kernel or check https://www.kaggle.com/bogikidd/related-ted-talks-recommendation for more details.

Enjoy!
